# DCGAN with Keras

## Objectives

In this notebook we are going to focus on two objectives:

- Understand Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs and GANs)

- Design and train DCGANs using the Keras API in Python

By the end, we will have built and trained a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) with Keras to generate images of fashionable clothes.

## Structure

The hands on project on Generating Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Kerasis divided into following tasks:

- Task 1: Project Overview and Import Libraries
- Task 2:  Load and Preprocess the Data
- Task 3: Create Batches of Training Data
- Task 4: Build the Generator Network for DCGAN
- Task 5: Build the Discriminator Network for DCGAN
- Task 6: Compile the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
- Task 7: Define the Training Procedure
- Task 8: Train DCGAN
- Task 9: Generate Synthetic Images with DCGAN
